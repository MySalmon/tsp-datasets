# Homberger & Gehring

The version reported here has a hierarchical objective:
1. Minimize number of vehicles 
1. Minimize total distance.

Distance and time should be calculated with double precision, total distance results are rounded to two decimals. Exact methods typically use a total distance objective and use integral or low precision distance and time calculations. Hence, results are not directly comparable.
